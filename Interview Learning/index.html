        <h4>1. Throttling:</h4>
        <span>
          Throttling is also just calling a expensive function and limiting the
          rate of execution of that function. It is just calling the function
          within some time intervals in between.

          Debouncing is nothing more just limiting the rate with which a
          function is executed or called this function is generally going to be
          a expensive function.

          Currying is a concept in computer science and functional programming
          where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a
          sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.

The function should return an object with all the key-value pairs of the input object, where any nested objects are flattened to a single level. If a key has a value of null or undefined, it should still be included in the output object. Below are some input and expected output examples: "

Your task is to create a function that takes a nested structure as input and returns a flattened array of objects, preserving the original order of items."
