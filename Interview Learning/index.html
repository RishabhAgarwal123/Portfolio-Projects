            Throttling is also just calling a expensive function and limiting
            the rate of execution of that function. It is just calling the
            function within some time intervals in between.

          <span>
            Pseudo-classes are keywords that can be added to selectors in CSS to
            target elements based on their state or position in the document
            tree. They allow you to style elements in dynamic ways that go
            beyond simply selecting elements based on their tag names, IDs, or
            classes.
          </span>
        </div>

          <h4>10. Pseudo Elements:</h4>
          <span>
            Pseudo-elements are similar to pseudo-classes, but they allow you to
            style specific parts of an element rather than the whole element
            itself. Here's a list of commonly used pseudo-elements in CSS along
            with their definitions:
          </span>
        </div>
        <ul class="pseudo">
          <li>

            the user.

      <!-- Execution Context -->
      <div class="border">
        <div class="div">
          <h4>11. Execution Context:</h4>
          <div class="pseudo">
            An execution context in JavaScript is an abstract concept that
            defines the environment in which JavaScript code is executed. It
            includes the variables, functions, and other data structures that
            are accessible during the execution of a piece of code.
            Understanding execution context is crucial for understanding how
            JavaScript code behaves.
            <br />
            There are three types of execution contexts in JavaScript: <br />
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Global Execution Context:</strong> This is the default
                or outermost execution context. It is created when a script is
                executed and remains active until the script finishes. In a web
                browser, the global execution context represents the window
                object. Variables and functions declared outside of any function
                are attached to the global object (window in browsers).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Function Execution Context:</strong> Every time a
                function is called, a new execution context is created for that
                function. This context includes the function's arguments, local
                variables, and a reference to the outer lexical environment (the
                environment in which the function was declared). When the
                function completes execution, its execution context is popped
                off the call stack. Eval Function
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Execution Context:</strong> The eval function in
                JavaScript is used to execute code stored in a string. When eval
                is called, a new execution context is created for the evaluated
                code. However, due to security and performance concerns, it's
                generally recommended to avoid using eval whenever possible.
              </li>
            </ol>
