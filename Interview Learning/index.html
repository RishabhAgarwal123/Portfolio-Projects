            Throttling is also just calling a expensive function and limiting
            the rate of execution of that function. It is just calling the
            function within some time intervals in between.

            function is executed or called this function is generally going to
            be a expensive function.

          <span>
            Pseudo-classes are keywords that can be added to selectors in CSS to
            target elements based on their state or position in the document
            tree. They allow you to style elements in dynamic ways that go
            beyond simply selecting elements based on their tag names, IDs, or
            classes.

        </div>
        <ul class="pseudo">

          <h4>10. Pseudo Elements:</h4>
          <span>
            Pseudo-elements are similar to pseudo-classes, but they allow you to
            style specific parts of an element rather than the whole element
            itself. Here's a list of commonly used pseudo-elements in CSS along
            with their definitions:
          </span>
