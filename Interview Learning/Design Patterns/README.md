What are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems guidelines on how to tackle certain problems. They are not classes, package pr libraries that you can plug into your application and wait for the magic to happen. These are, rather, guidelines on how to tackle certain problems in certain situations.
Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems guidelines on how to handle certain problems.

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

1. Design patterns are not a silver bullet to all your problems.
2. Do not try to force them bad things are supposed to happen, if done so. Keep in mind that design patterns are solutions to problems, not solutions finding problems so don't overthink.
3. If used in a correct place in a correct manner, they can prove to be a savior or else they can result in a horrible mess of a code.

Types of Design Pattens:

1. Creational: Creational patterns are focused towards how to instantiate a group of related objects means it deals with the object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or adding complexity to design. They solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

   1. Simple Factory
   2. Factory Method
   3. Abstract Factory
   4. Builder
   5. Prototype
   6. Singleton

2. Structural: Structural patterns are mostly concernced with object composition or in other words how the entities can use each other. or they help in answering, How to build a software component. In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

   1. Adapter
   2. Bridge
   3. Composite
   4. Decorator
   5. Facade
   6. Flyweight
   7. Proxy

3. Behavioral: It is concernced with assignment of responsibilites between the objects. What makes them different from structural patterns is they don't just specify the structure but also outlines the patterns for message passing/communication between them. They assist in answering: How to run a behavior in software somponent ?. In software engineering, behavior design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

   1. Chain of Responsibility
   2. Command
   3. Iterator
   4. Mediator
   5. Memento
   6. Observer
   7. Visitor
   8. Strategy
   9. State
   10. Template Method
